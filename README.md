# NLP_COVID19
Final Project for UVA CS4501-MMM

##Introduction
Given the rapidly spreading of COVID19 worldwide, We think it is very relevant to provide scientific resources for people to better understand the virus. The more we learn about the virus, the more prepared we are to fight against it. In particular, we hope our results can be meaningful to reveal new facts about how contagious COVID19 is. In the light of evidence on incubation periods, people can make adjustments on how they take precautions. In addition, we will make our project technically challenging and intriguing. We will use pre-trained natural language processing (NLP) models (​sciBERT​) for scientific text mining and apply the model on the Kaggle ​dataset​ of recent manuscripts on COVID19.
